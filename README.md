Hello! Iâ€™m Juraj Szitas, a somewhat mad Econometrician turned Data Scientist. I keep my open source stuff here - in the hopes that someone finds it useful. 
I work primarily on Time Series and Time Series ensembling. 

Check out: 
 + [soothsayer](https://github.com/JSzitas/soothsayer) if you like the **fable** framework and like the idea of meta learning for time series 
 + [blazearima](https://github.com/JSzitas/blazearima) (WIP) A new ARIMA implementation done entirely in C++ for speed and efficiency.
 + [stack](https://github.com/JSzitas/stack) for some general notes on model stacking
 + [gpvolatility](https://github.com/JSzitas/gpvolatility) for an implementation of a funky volatility model
 + [treecoding](https://github.com/JSzitas/treecoding) for some interesting Trees and Forests (particularly an implementation of 'Autoencoder by Forest')
 + [nlsolver](https://github.com/JSzitas/nlsolver) Nonlinear optimizers as header-only, C++17 library. 

I am currently building a lot of things that I need in C++. 

You can reach me at my professional email(Juraj_Szitas@swissre.com).
