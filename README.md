Hello! Iâ€™m Juraj Szitas, a somewhat mad Econometrist turned Data Scientist. I keep my open source stuff here - in the hopes that someone finds it useful. 
I work primarily on Time Series and Time Series ensembling. 

Check out: 
 + [soothsayer](https://github.com/JSzitas/soothsayer) if you like the **fable** framework and like the idea of meta learning for time series 
 + [stack](https://github.com/JSzitas/stack) for some general notes on model stacking
 + [gpvolatility](https://github.com/JSzitas/gpvolatility) for an implementation of a funky volatility model
 + [treecoding](https://github.com/JSzitas/treecoding) for some interesting Trees and Forests (particularly an implementation of 'Autoencoder by Forest')

I am currently learning how to be a better C++ programmer, and implementing a few things along the way.

You can reach me at my professional email(Juraj_Szitas@swissre.com).
