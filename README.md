Hello! Iâ€™m Juraj Szitas.

I started out as an Econometrician, then I turned Data Scientist for a few years and eventually got sick of the AI hype. I currently work as a Quantitative Developer.
My biggest passion (as you would probably be able to guess from here) is numerics, closely followed by anything time series related. 

I keep my open source stuff here - in the hopes that someone finds it useful. It includes a lot of really neat little things that I either could not find elsewhere, 
or did not want to deal with the hassle of linking against/shipping with. 

Check out: 
 + [nlsolver](https://github.com/JSzitas/nlsolver) Nonlinear optimizers as header-only, C++17 library.
 + [tinyqr](https://github.com/JSzitas/tinyqr) A header-only, optimized C++17 implementation of the QR decomposition. 
 + [soothsayer](https://github.com/JSzitas/soothsayer) if you like the **fable** framework and the idea of meta learning for time series, you might like this
 + [blaze](https://github.com/JSzitas/blaze) (WIP) A full fledged time series forecasting and analysis toolkit in modern C++. 
   * contains a new (S)ARIMA(X) implementation leveraging SIMD
   * fully capable AR and AutoAR
   * Benchmark methods (Integrated Noise) 
   * miscellaneous time series utility functions (seasonality identification, stationarity tests)
 + [gpvolatility](https://github.com/JSzitas/gpvolatility) for an implementation of a funky volatility model

I mainly program C++/python these days, but I will do anything that's needed :) I have reached the point where getting things done in a timely manner matters most.
