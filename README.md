Hello! Iâ€™m Juraj Szitas, a somewhat mad Econometrician turned Data Scientist. I keep my open source stuff here - in the hopes that someone finds it useful. 
I work primarily on Time Series and Time Series ensembling. 

Check out: 
 + [soothsayer](https://github.com/JSzitas/soothsayer) if you like the **fable** framework and like the idea of meta learning for time series 
 + [blaze](https://github.com/JSzitas/blaze) (WIP) A full fledged time series forecasting and analysis toolkit in modern C++. 
   * contains a new (S)ARIMA(X) implementation leveraging SIMD
   * fully capable AR and AutoAR
   * Benchmark methods (Integrated Noise) 
   * miscellaneous time series utility functions (seasonality identification, stationarity tests)
 + [stack](https://github.com/JSzitas/stack) for some general notes on model stacking
 + [gpvolatility](https://github.com/JSzitas/gpvolatility) for an implementation of a funky volatility model
 + [treecoding](https://github.com/JSzitas/treecoding) for some interesting Trees and Forests (particularly an implementation of 'Autoencoder by Forest')
 + [nlsolver](https://github.com/JSzitas/nlsolver) Nonlinear optimizers as header-only, C++17 library. 

I am currently building a lot of things in C++, for profit and pleasure :)

You can reach me at my professional email(juraj@agnicio.com).
